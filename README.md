I created a simple task tracking web application using HTML CSS and JavaScript.

## The functionalities are:

When the user wants to add a task, they can enter and add this task through a form.

Added tasks are displayed on a list. Each task is displayed with completed or deleted buttons.

The status of tasks (completed/not completed) can be changed by user interaction.

Tasks can be deleted. Deletion is controlled by the checkbox.

Added tasks are stored using browser localStorage and are preserved even when the page is refreshed.

## Key achievements:

DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation and event listening.

Experience with data storage and recall using browser localStorage.

Having knowledge of basic animation and user interaction.
